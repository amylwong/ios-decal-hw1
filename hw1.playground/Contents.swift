//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They are the same type. In the instance variable, the exclamation mark forcefully unwraps the optional, which is guaranteed to have a String. If something else besides a String is passed in, then it would error. So the values passed in to the init function and those set to the instance variables must be the same type, String.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    static func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
      return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.

//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: Originally, the for loop used “let” keyword. “let” is used for constants, and you can only assign it a value once. The compiler did not like it because "i" is being incremented and reassigned at each loop. Also, if the word is indeed a palindrome, then the if case within the for loop will never get executed, so nothing gets returned. However, the function expects a Bool to be returned. Additionally, arePalindromes is being called on a class. You can't use instance methods on a class, so to change it to a class method, use the keyword "static". "var numElements" is changed to "let numElements" because numElements never changes, so setting it as a constant is more appropriate.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
     func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character : Int]() //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (_, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false 
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The syntax for declaring a dictionary is incorrect, because when Line Y is reached, it tries to update countLetters, which was never instantiated. At the very end of isAnagram, the original code tried to return nil. However, the return type expected is 'Bool', so nil is incorrect, and true is returned instead. The code at the very bottom calls isAnagram on an instance of the class. Thus, we need isAnagram to be an instance variable, so the removal of the "class" keyword fixes the error. lenA and lenB are never changed, so it should be declared as a constant. In the last for loop, letter is never used in each iteration, so we do not need to use an explicit variable, and should use _ instead.
